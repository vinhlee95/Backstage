# Gigle Backstage
## Installation
* Clone the repository
* Install dependencies and start 
```javascript
   npm install
   npm start
```

## Tech stalk 
* **React**
* **React Router**: handle navigation
* **Redux**: handle actions: *signup*, *login*, *save data*, *load data*
* **Redux Thunk**: handle asynchronous actions
* **Firebase**: handle authentication and data saving 
* **CSS Module**: writing individual CSS file for every component. Each component folder normally consists 1 JS file and 1 CSS file containing equivalent style rules for that component. 
* **Material UI**: implement Google's Material Design for React components
* **React MD Spinner**: Material Design spinner components for React.js
* **Google Map React**: show Google Map view 
* **React Places Autocomplete**: build a customized UI for Google Maps Places Autocomplete

## Bugs
* Loading a spinner/ logo when the component is re-rendering and reloading the authentication status
* uid & Route path
* If user is in Profile page & refresh, content disappear, only going back if navigate back from another route
